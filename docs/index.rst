CPUid Documentation
===================

cpuid is a C++ library for CPU dispatching. Currently the project can detect the following CPU capabilities:

* Instruction sets detected on x86: FPU, MMX, SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3,
  SSE 4.1, SSE 4.2, PCLMULQDQ, AVX, AVX2 and AVX-512 extensions.

* Instruction sets detected on ARM: NEON

We have created cpuid to fit our specific needs, however we hope that
others may also find it useful. When designing cpuid we found
inspiration in these other nice projects:

* CPUID article on Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPUID

* zchotia's gist: https://gist.github.com/zchothia/3078968

* Facebook CPU ID implementation:
   https://github.com/facebook/folly/blob/master/folly/CpuId.h

* ARM Cortex-A Programmer's guide:
   http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.den0013d/index.html

* IntelÂ® Architecture Instruction Set Extensions Programming Reference: https://software.intel.com/content/dam/develop/public/us/en/documents/architecture-instruction-set-extensions-programming-reference.pdf

The cpuid repository: https://github.com/steinwurf/cpuid

The ``examples`` folder contains some programs that demonstrate the usage
of the available API.

If you have any questions or suggestions about this library, please contact
us at our developer mailing list (hosted at Google Groups):
